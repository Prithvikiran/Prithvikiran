# Hi, I'm Prithvi 👋

Aspiring **Applied AI / ML Engineer** focused on **LLMs, retrieval‑augmented systems, and data‑driven products**.  
Currently pursuing a **Master's in Computer Science at CU Boulder** and building end‑to‑end AI solutions from prototyping to deployment.

***

## What I'm interested in

- Applied AI engineering and **LLM‑powered applications** (agents, RAG, copilots)
- **Inference optimization**: latency, cost, and reliability for production LLM workloads
- **Data mining & labor‑market analytics** – predicting future skills and job trends

***

## Skills & tools

- **Languages:** Python, SQL  
- **ML / AI:** PyTorch, Transformers, LLM fine‑tuning, RAG, evaluation  
- **Data & Infra:** AWS, Docker, Kubernetes basics, Supabase, Colab  
- **Workflow:** Git, GitHub, Jupyter/Colab, experimentation tracking

***

## Highlight projects

- **Job Market Prediction (Data Mining):**  
  Forecasting emerging skills using multi‑source labor‑market and investment signals; focuses on forward‑looking indicators rather than just historical job posts.

- **LLM Benchmarking for SQL Generation:**  
  Evaluating LLMs on the BIRD dataset and optimizing prompts/architectures for accuracy, robustness, and execution‑aware SQL generation.

- **RAG & Agentic Workflows:**  
  Prototyping custom RAG + tool‑using agents for meeting automation, hallucination reduction, and workflow orchestration.

***

## What I'm currently doing

- Building **small, production‑oriented AI projects** that connect models to real data and users  
- Exploring **agentic AI, MCP‑style tool use, and evaluation pipelines** for reliability
- Preparing for roles in **Applied AI / ML Engineering** and **AI Infrastructure Engineering**
